Population genetics tests and estimators for pooled NGS data

This code implements some population genetics tests and estimators that can be applied to pooled sequences from Next Generation Sequencing experiments. The statistics are described in the paper "Population genomics from pool sequencing" by L. Ferretti, S.E. Ramos-Onsins and M. Perez-Enciso, Molecular Ecology (2013), DOI: 10.1111/mec.12522.
